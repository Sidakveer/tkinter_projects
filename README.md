# tkinter_projects
This repository consists of projects made using **GUI tkinter** from the python in-built library.

## Miles_to_km
This is a simple project which displays a miles to km converter. The user inputs the value in miles and clicks on the calculate button, the program then 
calculates and returns the value in kilometres.

## pomodoro_timer
This is a basic timer we have build which follows a pomodoro technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
It uses aÂ timer to break work into intervals, in our program the work length is 25 minutes, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes each and after every 4 
work iterations the timer displays a long break of 20 minutes. The timer starts or resets depending on which of the buttons diplayed are pressed.
